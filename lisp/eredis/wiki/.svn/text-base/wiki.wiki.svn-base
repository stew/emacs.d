#summary Eveything you need to know to use eredis

= Introduction =

I thought it would be cool to be able to interact with Redis within emacs, and specifically to be able to pull keys into an [http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Built_002din-table-editor.html org-table] so you can easily edit it.

= Installation =

Download the latest version via svn or from the downloads page. Add the path you downloaded it to in your .emacs file:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/eredis/")

(require 'eredis)

= Usage =

First connect to the server. Some of the commands are interactive but all work from the emacs lisp REPL. To get that: 

M-x ielm

A redis session begins by connecting to a server:

(eredis-hai "localhost" "6379")

and ends by closing the connection:

(eredis-kthxbye)

Most commands receive a string response from Redis such as eredis-ping, which returns "PONG". Some return lists of strings, and others return maps of key value pairs. I've tried to follow the principle of least surprise when implementing each call. 

Some examples of basic usage:

(eredis-set "key" "value")
"ok"

(eredis-get "key") 
"value"

==Monitor Mode==

All commands work as you would expect, except for monitor. Monitor starts to show all the commands going to the Redis server, and as such does not fit with a single asynchronous API call. What I do instead is to switch you to the *redis* buffer where you can watch the commands. Hit C-g to exit this mode. You will need to reconnect to the Redis server once you are done, because the QUIT command that exits the client from monitor mode seems to close the connection too.

(eredis-monitor)

==Org table mode==

This is the stuff I'm most excited about that sets the emacs client apart from other client libs for Redis. Interacting with the data in Redis in ad hoc, super easy to create tables, seems like a potentially very powerful and fun tool.

Support so far includes creating org tables from various data types:


And sending data from an org table (assumes string types only for now but will be expanded)

(eredis-org-table-from-set "s1")

(eredis-org-table-from-zset "z1")

(eredis-org-table-from-zset "z1" 'withscores)

(eredis-org-table-from-hash "testhash1")

(eredis-org-table-from-list "l1")

(eredis-org-table-from-pattern "configparam.*.server1")

(defun eredis-org-table-mset()
  "with point in an org table convert the table to a map and send it to redis with mset"

(defun eredis-org-table-msetnx()
  "with point in an org table convert the table to a map and send it to redis with msetnx"
 
(defun eredis-org-table-row-set()
  "with point in an org table set the key and value"

More to come

==More caveats==

Almost the entire Redis API works no problem, except for the publish subscribe commands, which I have a little more work to do on. Same goes for MULTI and EXEC. These commands work, but the output of the final EXEC is not correctly parsed yet.

Use emacs function help (C-h f eredis- TAB) should give you a good idea what you can do...
